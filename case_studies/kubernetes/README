This Kubernetes example is based on https://github.com/vasanthbala/hackathon/tree/master/kbp/redis

# Generate the yaml (actually json) files for Kubernetes:
jsonnet -m example.jsonnet

# Check they are the same as the original handwritten files:
python test_same.py

# Clean up
rm -v *.out *.new.yaml
